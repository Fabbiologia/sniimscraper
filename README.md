The goal of sniimscraper is to webscrape fish price data from Mexican
markets and middlemens and being able to monitor trends. You can
download several dates and compile a large database, or contact me to
have a cleaned one.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Fabbiologia/sniimscraper")
```

## Example

This is a basic example:

``` r
library(sniimscraper)
get_price_data()
```
