<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of sniimscraper is to webscrape fish price data from Mexican markets and middlemens and being able to monitor trends. You can download several dates and compile a large database, or contact me to have a cleaned one. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of sniimscraper from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:


```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Fabbiologia/sniimscraper")
```

## Example

This is a basic example:

```{r example, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(sniimscraper)
get_price_data()
```
